what happens to the heart rate (usually) before a heart attack		Drop in heart rate variability in the 10 minutes prior to ischemia and a further steep drop in the few minutes prior to ischemia.  Shows a drop prior to myocardial ischemia - reduction of your relaxation parasympathetic nervous system ➔ More announced in people who are mentally active/stressed => High levels of mental arousal and low levels of parasympathetic activity.			
Effects of mental stress on coronary vasodiameter (diameter of arteries)		Mental stress also results in an extra narrowing of the coronary arteries. If an artery is narrowed/stenoses you see a higher load with mental stress.  If the mental stress isn't as high, you see that the arteries don’t change much. ➔ The more diseased arteries, the more they narrow →heart has to work harder with stress and the diseased parts of the coronary arteries constrict, both contributing to the likelihood of myocardial ischemia

In plaque you do not only see LDL/cholesterol type, but also 2 types of immune system products: - Apoptotic macrophages - T-cells This indicates that the immune system plays an essential role in the early stages of the atherosclerotic disease process.			
why depression is a cardiovascular risk factor		- Central nervous system which affects the output system of the CNS like neurohormones and sympathetic/parasympathetic balance which shifts to lower parasympathetic and higher sympathetic activity.  The biological changes of the CNS than result in changes in the immune system.

After the release of the egg the membrane where the egg was in is shrinking into the corpus luteum/yellow substance.			
LH is involved in ...		ovulation and menstrual cycle			
different phases of the menstrual cycle		Follicular phase - Ovulation (middle of the cycle) - Luteal phase - Menstruation -> (repeat)			
The menstrual cycle is driven by hormones...		Starts with GnRH production in the hypothalamus and the FSH and LH hormones in the anterior pituitary gland			
How does the follicle affect hormone levels during the menstrual cycle		The follicle produces the hormone oestrogen/oestradiol.			
Progestore and Oestrogens function		Later on the ovarian cycle the corpus luteum produces progesterone and oestrogens which has an impact on the uterus: ▪ Breaking down of the endometrium ▪ Building up the endometrium by oestrogen produced by follicles. ▪ Ovulation: corpus luteum starts to produce oestrogen progesterone combination which further thickens the endometrium to welcome the fertilized egg.  => If there isn’t an fertilized egg, menstruation sets in after the luteal phase.			
Ovarian cycle		GnRH starts stimulating FSH => Follicles are maturing and growing until the follicle ruptures and the egg is being released = ovulation.  => The corpus luteum produces progesterone which has an effect on the endometrium and then the cycle begins again.   (Sometimes more eggs mature and ripe which causes heterozygotic twins)			
Hormonal control of the female reproductive cycle		"Ovaries provide feedback to the hypothalamus by the production of oestradiol/oestrogen. Type of feedback and amount of oestradiol/oestrogens depends on the phase. Basis is similar across all phases  ""The ovarian and menstrual cycles of female reproduction are regulated by hormones produced by the hypothalamus, pituitary, and ovaries. The pattern of activation and inhibition of these hormones varies between phases of the reproductive cycle"""			
follicular phase of ovarian cycle		FSH predominates during days 1-13, the ovarian follicles develop and estrogen secretion by follicles is stimulated  GnRH=> increases LH and FSH => follicles form then  Follicles start to produce oestrogen which has a negative inhibiting effect on the hypothalamus which tells it to reduce the release of GnRH and therefor reducing release of LH and FSH. Oestrogen also causes the endometrium arteries to constrict which results in the breaking down of the endometrium (menstruation)			
ovulation phase of ovarian cycle		Day 14 1. Peak in LH induces ovulation 2. LH peak + FSH slight rise produces cascade that stimulates ovulation  (Oocyte release from mature follicle)			
luteal phase of ovarian cycle		LH predominates during days 15-28, LH stimulates secretion of progesterone by the corpus luteum  => egg is popped out and the corpus luteum starts to produce oestrogen and progesterone which has a negative effect on both the hypothalamus and anterior pituitary gland (inhibition). Also an effect on the endometrium telling it to thicken further.

different sexes genotype vs phenotype		XX - Female XY - Male X0 - Female (turners syndrome) XXX - Female XXY - Male (klinefelter) XYY - Male  XY insensitive to androgens - Female XX increased testosterone - Female			
sex development in the brain		Sexual development is caused by: Male: Testosterone converted into oestradiol which masculinizes the neurons of the brain  Female: Protected from masculinizing effects of oestradiol.The protein ‘alphafetoprotein’ binds to oestrogens and stops it entering the brain ➔ So there is a difference in the brain.
